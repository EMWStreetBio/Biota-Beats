                        <p>The combination of arts and science captures our imaginations with compelling narratives of
                            initiative and innovation. People go beyond traditional ways to work in whatever medium best
                            fits their skills and messages. By rooting stories in authenticity, people can spark emotion
                            and action, transmit values and information, foster collaboration, and invent the
                            future.</p>

                        <p>Lifeforms inhabiting the surface of our bodies need a form of communication for people to
                            understand the information those lifeforms contained. What if we can hear the physical
                            attributes of a microbiota? Music, as a universal language, suggests a certain wholeness.
                            Sonification of the microbiome is an attempt to engage the public and provide a better
                            understanding of the random nature of gene expression, cellular changes, and bacterial
                            evolutions. Such an undertaking can bring personal understanding to what is going on with
                            the surface of our bodies.</p>

                            <h2>Cool… but what is BIOTA BEATS?
                            </h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>Biota Beats is hardware-meets-wetware-meets-software, an interdisciplinary project designed
                            to
                            help translate this complex microbiota-related information onto a higher and more visceral
                            level—music.</p>

                        <p>As discussed above, there are clear medical applications for microbiome data. From a
                            technical
                            perspective, clinicians could use this to help analyze and diagnose various health concerns.
                            From a social equity-focused perspective, we also note the added value in parsing technical
                            information to create music that lies in increasing accessibility for the average person
                            looking
                            to better understand their health. In linking bacterial phenotypes of interest—speed and
                            patterns of growth, color, origin on the body—to musical features, people can listen to the
                            generated music to obtain an intuitive understanding of the salient points of their
                            microbiome
                            profile. And from an artistic perspective, the interface of music and science core in the
                            design
                            and function of Biota Beats runs beautifully through several metaphors.</p>

                        <p>Already, the motifs of this project are clear—of community, of transfer and exchange, of life
                            in
                            all its forms.</p>

                        <p> That’s what our community biology lab at EMW Street Bio wanted to find out.
                            Our team has built a record player called Biota Beats that can hold a petri dish plated with
                            cultures from the human microbiome. Currently, a still image is taken of the colonies and
                            translated into sound by a program coded by one of our teammates, but the ultimate vision
                            for Biota Beats is real-time tracking of colonies and conversion of a video into sound.
                            <br/>
                            With Biota Beats, you’ll be able to listen to music from different cultures!

                <h3>History of the Record Player</h3>
            </header>
            <article class="row">
                <p>The evolution of the record player starts in July of 1877 when Edison filed his first patent in Great
                    Britain on the recording and reproduction of sound. Full specifications for the phonograph were
                    filed in April 1878. Later in 1881, Alexander Graham Bell, his cousin Chichester Bell, and
                    assistants created what would become known as the Graphophone, an improved version of the
                    phonograph, and donate a prototype to the Smithsonian Institution. The graphophone used wax as the
                    recording medium rather than tin foil like the phonograph, and the recording was cut or chiseled
                    into the wax rather than being embossed. </p>
                <p>In 1894, Emile Berliner introduced a commercial version of the gramophone that he had been developing
                    since 1887. The player used a disc instead of a cylinder and was made of zinc coated with wax. Come
                    2016, EMW Street Bio iGEM team has modified the gramophone to record the visuals of a petri dish
                    “disc” rotating in the place of a vinyl disc. From those images, sound is generated based on
                    algorithms measuring colony position, density, and size.

                <h3>The human microbiome</h3>
            </header>
            <article class="row">
                <p>In the mirror, we all see ourselves as one whole, independent organism. Wave at your
                    reflection.
                    Smile. Wiggle your ears. You might think, ‘Hey, this is me.’</p>

                <p>...But think again. This perspective overlooks the trillions of bacteria that live on and
                    inside
                    your body—your very own microbiome. The earth is teeming with bacteria and other
                    microorganisms,
                    and guess what? The place in the world with the highest density of these tiny creatures is
                    in
                    right in your colon.</p>

                <p>So, what are all these organisms doing in your body, and how are they affecting you? The
                    answers
                    are still being investigated today, but the recent studies have come to some interesting
                    conclusions. In order to study this question, scientists bred a mouse strain without a
                    microbiome, a blank slate upon which to observe phenotypes of different gut profiles, and
                    then
                    designed experiments involving the transfer of fecal matter containing a portion of a
                    microbial
                    ecosystem. Based on this framework, one group of scientists used mice described as ‘shy’ as
                    stool donors for the microbiome-deficient mice, hoping to observe some perceptible change in
                    the
                    recipients. Imagine the excitement when rather than just a minor change (or nothing at all),
                    the
                    researchers saw the recipient mice display personality traits from the donors!</p>

                <p>What about humans, you ask? So far, researchers have found a similar connection between our
                    microbiomes and brains and health. For instance, the tendency towards overweightness or
                    obesity
                    can also be influenced by your microbiota, as well as countless other complex phenotypes.
                    But,
                    let’s backtrack even further: how is this relationship even possible? Current scientific
                    consensus has dubbed this the “brain-gut-microbiota axis,” composed of the vagus nerve,
                    immune
                    system, and more, a physical basis for this still-mysterious association.</p>

                <p>Enthusiasm over these findings has already led to visions of a whole new pathway for medical
                    therapy. Among those already invested in this field is OpenBiome, a nonprofit stool bank
                    which
                    gathers healthy samples from individuals to support research into microbiota and fecal
                    microbiota transplants (FMT). Interested? Provided you pass the rigorous screenings, you
                    could
                    find yourself donating stool and becoming a part of this movement too.</p>
